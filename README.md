### Background
Disneyland is the most magical place on earth and thousands of people visit every year. In this study, we are looking to analyze visitors’ experience by looking at the reviews for 3 different parks Hong Kong, California, and Paris. However, numbers and star reviews do not give an accurate picture of the full experience visitors enjoy at Disney Parks. By analyzing text reviews, Disney Parks can learn more about their visitors and their needs and wants; and the metrics associated with good reviews. After all, qualitative data can inform action items better.
