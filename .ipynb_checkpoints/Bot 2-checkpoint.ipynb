trip reports for once 'm in the park 'm there to stay until they kick me out at night so well past closing if  can manage it he entire package has delighted me since  was a small child and continues to delight me and my step son but not so much his mom now ost visitors pass through ain treet and look at it as a blockade to get by in order to reach the rides in the other lands  look at ain treet and notice how it was set up to begin with the right side of the street is adorned with stores that will sell people things that they need in order to have a good day at the parks he left side is filled with stores that carry things that people may want to get on their way out of the parks his is because by nature people gravitate towards walking on the right hand side of the street hat type of thinking is just a small step in why the thought process behind this park has been nothing short of genius despite the many detractors the park has gained over the last twenty years omorrowland isn't looking much like the orld on the ove that it once used to represent any park visitors find issue with this without understanding that at the rate technology moves in this age there is no possible way that omorrowland could keep up with new discoveries in order to truly represent a orld of omorrow ecause of that it has shifted focus to be more like a world of what might be   a world of possibilities f course there are also a lot of comic things going on in there and for some reason uzz ightyear is a part of the future hat's ok though because the ride is still funantasyland is a favorite for park guests 'm still trying to figure out why personally his part of the park is one that  often try to avoid if not for the atterhorn being located for sure inside antasyland now  probably wouldn't really go into this part of the park he dark rides while classics are simply not long enough to warrant the lines that pile up to get onto them 'm looking right at eter an for that complaint honestlynow hite's cary dventure is both not scary and also not now hite's dventure as it seems to follow the vil ueen around a whole lot more than her eck they even have the vil ueen living inside the house for the seven warf's for some reasonr oad's ild ide is definitely a classic but is also slightly confusing because  can't remember the last time isney has shown r oad in much of anything ranted  don't catch every isney movie airing but since it was paired with the eadless orsemen cartoon and  think isney stopped airing that because it might scare children  just don't see many kids relating to r oad or oad all anymore inochio is still fun despite inochio still being a puppet at the end of it when he's supposed to be a real boy the torybookland anal is a fun slow paced boating venture with highly detailed displays of character homes and locations spread all throughout it ven better is when the occasional duck has invaded the town or the occasional cat has found its way into the mix and is just sitting there in all its huge glory compared to the small models around it he ast embers always have something fun to say about that mall orld should have been blown up years ago oon own offers lots of interaction with objects and buildings which  believe most park visitors miss nfortunately a lot of things have been taken away from it oofy no longer has a ounce ouse the olly rolly no longer moves at all let alone moves with the old bouncing gait it had etc here are still fun things to do here and things to explore and discover however oon own also features a fun pair of rides in adget's o oaster and oger abbit's artoon pin  prefer the o oaster to the artoon pin personally t might last about a minute once  get on but the line is usually not as long as artoon pinrontierland has lost a lot of what made it seem like a real frontier in terms of things to do  feel erhaps that's just me growing up of course hunder ountain recently came out of a seriously delayed refurbishment and the new effects on the last lift were looking great he rest of the land sparkles with old time goodness and the remnants of the old ine rain through ature's onderland are nice nods at the past as well ew rleans quare still qualifies as my favorite area of the park ooking out over the ivers of merica is still peaceful even if a ride on the ark wain still bores me to tears irates of the aribbean is still located here despite the lame makeover they did to it with the irates of the aribbean films and the switch from it being a fantastical look at what pirate life might have been like to a more unified search for aptain ack parrow including ack parrow animatronics and characters throughout the ride asking about him a good dozen times in the span of fifteen minutes eck there is even a ego figure of aptain ack parrow standing in the treasure room which just gives him one more appearance he didn't need t's still a good ride though which just shows how strong it was before because if this was built immediately after the films 'm not sure it would be half as popular as it is today and that's even with the popularity of it fading as lines for it aren't as long as they used to be on a regular basis he aunted ansion luckily avoided a movie makeover from the film with ddie urphy  believe isney took one look at that prospect and realized that if it had gone through with something like that they would have needed to find a replacement for aunted ansion in a few years as it would have killed the attraction completelyritter ountry has very little do to with ritters anymore he only ritters here are found in plash ountain he  of the critters in this area are stuffed animals found in innie the ooh and the innie the ooh and friends meet and greets outside of plash ountain he old shops in ritter ountry have all been made over to ooh orner which means more stuffed animals f course plash ountain came before the innie the ooh attraction in this area but it would be nice if isney could face up to the fact that ritter ountry was destroyed with the removal of the ountry ear amboree and installation of stuffed animals in their place dventureland is a nicely detailed area of the park arzan's reehouse may leave something to be desired by some park guests but it still holds enough nods to the previous wiss amily obinson treehouse that it was made over from that it still holds a bit of relevance ndiana ones and the emple of the orbidden ye didn't turn out the way it was originally planned which would have had it snaking through different attractions including the ungle ruise hat being said it's still one of the best themed attractions in the park eople who skip the queue to get fast passes end up missing out on a few different very cool things to do in the queue itself nd of course the ride when everything works which seems to be a rarity is wonderful if not shaky as all heck he ungle ruise is a great way to pass some time but the enjoyment if you've been on it before relies massively upon the skipper on subsequent voyages 've had some really lousy skippers on my different rides over the rivers presented in the cruise  know this because 've also had some great skippers on the cruise that made waiting for the ride worth it he nchanted ikki oom with its secret bathrooms although not so secret as the ones in he emple of the orbidden ye and the ole hips is a fan favorite but not one that  remember ever seeing until the last few years y initial reaction to the attraction was that  didn't know what the big deal was ater that night  found myself marveling at how the entire room had come to life and how much moving machinery behind the walls that must have taken to accomplish ood offerings in the park have grown from poor to great over the last two decades  understand a lot of visitors still refuse to eat there and find the food to be cheap but  can happily attest that those people are out of their minds reparation and quality has increased dramatically throughout the different eateries at the resort and people who were burned by the food offerings two decades ago should give them another chance

our favorite attractions and use the fast pass in the evening   you get through in  minutes or less f you use the fast pass between pm pm its not worth it because that is when the crowds are at the highest and it saves you nothingif anything you may even wait longer on the fast pass line during the day  would recommend leaving the park around pm to take a break especially if its hot and come back in the evening around pm t's easier to get on rides while people are watching the fireworks and fantasmic aiting in long lines especially in the heat can ware you out    e were at the park from am to pm on the first day and went on  rides using this system f you don't have a magic morning pass  would recommend still going to the park on this day ven though there are people in the park already it's not as crowded as the days there is no magic morning aybe most people prefer to go to california adventure assuming it's already crowded e did not have magic morning passes but this was the day we went on the most rides our better off getting to the ride early to pick up fast passes and making the trip back in the evening as appose to waiting   minutes in a line during the dayall the fast passes have ran out by the evening and there aren't as much fast pass holders walking around at night aking both trips   you save a good  minutes ust make sure you make enough time to use all the fast passes you picked up lan accordingly f you start picking up the fast passes in the morningits easier especially if you want to ride twice ost staff members we encountered were friendly there were a few that were very cranky and rude but  will get to that verall isney is a great place to visit  would definately recommend getting there early e there by  hey open at am even on magic morning days when they open privately at still be there at  because you will have more done by the end of the day isney is it's best and more magical in the mornings he prices for food however are outrageous e ate cerial for breakfast in our rooms we came back to our rooms for lunch and made sandwiches and we would eat dinner at a restaurant outside of the park e saved so much moneyand we were able to get the kids souvenirs and and give them a break from the park hey took naps in the middle of the days and were well behaved at night and lasted until pm in the park he ickets are expensive but way worth the money for all that we had done we even saw fansasmic the fireworks and captain and still had time on our hands to walk around and shop isiting isneyland with my  brother and  and  yr sisters was every bit as magical as  remembered it   it really  the happiest place on earth if you put an effort and plan it rightin the morning that is  gave t four stars because of two reasons he first is because because of all the rude and unruly guests that try to cut you in line and push through the crowds e had a family chain and a woman literally came and pushed between my brother and sister who were holding hands nother thingif you do antasmic   arrive early if you want a good seat t seamed that even though the show started at  we got there at pm and it was already about full e were very fortunate to find descent seats that a crew member lead us too eep your whole party with you we saw a a little family in front of us that was trying to save a little area for more family who had gone to dinnerpeople were fighting with them and trying to steal their seatseven after you could  see they were saving the seatsthey eventually resorted to laying on the growneven then people were desperate enough to ask them if they were saving those seats eware of mean people who don't care about your chidren and will do anything they can to cut in line steal your seat or even push your kids out of the way to get to where they need to go ike  saidthe isney magic ends around am he second thing was when we arrived back at the park    we came back in the middle of the second day onna  who was checking the tickets almost didn't let us in because our stamps were washed off ven though my oyfriend still had his stamp on it didn't matter   my siblings and  didn't have our stamps and that's all that mattered to her even though we had our entry tickets e told her they must have washed off with getting in a pool jacuzzi showering and washing hands as much as we doand she said well everyone else still has theirs and they go in pools o she basically called me a liar  went to guest services and complained f my boyfriend hadn't shown her a picture we took in the park then she wouldn't have let us ineven then she was  iffy  because we had on different clothing  understand that isney needs to keep track of scammers but do it the right waythey should have a bar scan on the ticket that has our names in itthis way we have to use our 's and tickets to get into the park ou can't not let someone in who paid for their tickets at isneyland hat if  had no pictures with me  dollars worth of tickets and you have to rely on stamps when  have my ticket in my hand eriously  don't think this is the way r isney would have wanted it nd  even got stamped twiceonce at isneyland and once at alifornia dventure  the first day it stayed on but it seems when we were stamped the next day the stamp  over inked  us ut more money into ito those little cards check 's and do it right t seems that all the nice people that worked there were all young kids and people in thier s and s people ll the rude and obnoxious people were the middle aged and elderly hate to put it that way but that's the truth nother lady freaked out on a young kid who was leaning on a chain ho does that f you don't like your job then don't work there don't be rude especially at isneyland owever the rest of our stay was perfect so that's why  only took off one rating o other then rude peopleit was amazing trip\",\n",

alt isney orld near rlando is a trip to isneyland worth it or can you get much of the same experiences in entral loridairstly isneyland is made up of only two theme parks one of which isney alifornia dventure had a troubled and frustrating gestation before finally getting itself on track only in recent years isney   s keystone in alifornia is isneyland itself the original  park that took elements from existing merican theme parks and pleasure gardens and perfectly fused them together into    the    definitive family entertainment destinationalt isney orld in lorida was an effort to break free of the historic limitations of the alifornia site and over the years has expanded to a total of four parks across enormous acreage he most recognisable park is agic ingdom and it is this park that is a homage to isneyland lements are shared between the parks but none are true replicas of one another gentle facsimiles persist but many seemingly familiar attractions have slight differences and many attractions are unique to one location or the otherisneyland and agic ingdom are therefore closely related while alifornia dventure shares some of its heritage with the content of isney   s other lorida offerings ollywood tudios o and nimal ingdomrom a purely package holiday perspective  wins with a much larger size it   s much more capable of sustaining a family vacation for a much longer visit the typical two weeks that ritish visitors are likely to book here are other benefits too multiple isney owned hotels on site restaurants aplenty water parks shopping  entertainment and close by niversal lorida and eaorld too  is cleverly designed to act as the hub for all of your holiday needs and is increasingly with dining packages digital ticketing multiple pre bookable attractions and experiences a completely integrated isney experience from sun up to sun downisneyland is a very different experience to its upstart younger sibling and this is where some very surprising elements reveal themselvesor starters isneyland is small though they may look similar agic ingdom is quite a bit larger and inderella   s astle in lorida is massive when compared to naheim   s original leeping eauty astle he limited scale of isneyland was a necessity of the constraints of the original site and of alt being unable to afford more land when embarking on the project ith finances tight isneyland was soon hemmed in by hotels restaurants and vacant lots purchased by speculative real estate developers ver the years isneyland   s designers have become adept at squeezing attractions into an increasingly full plot the result is a surprisingly intimate experience that  seeks to duplicate but because of its more generous size and despite using clever tricks with scale and perspective doesn   t quite manage to replicate isneyland still has alt   s influence around every corner and though planned and conceived by him  didn   t even break ground until after alt   s deathecondly isneyland is much more of a local   s park that   s not to say that hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors or those from across much of the  don   t venture to naheim it   s just that the overwhelming majority of visitors are from the  and outhern alifornia conurbation and this lends the park a more casual vibe any alifornian   s are day visitors or just there on short stays and the popularity of annual passes mean that many can drop in for an afternoon or evening visit almost any day of the week ttendance levels can therefore fluctuate dramatically at times outside of peak demand particularly during mid week the parks can be remarkably quiet compared to lorida alt isney orld is becoming much more of a year round destination to the point where crowds are flattening out and periods that have historically benefitted from low attendances are starting to get squeezedhe next difference is in the time you may want to dedicate to visiting the parks isneyland esort that   s isneyland and the neighbouring isney alifornia dventure can be attempted at the right time of year in just two days one day for each park n some favourable circumstances a reasonable taster of both parks can even be managed in a single day his opens up isney as a vacation excursion destination something that can be added but need not dominate a busy schedule spent visiting os ngeles an iego or other alifornian cities and landmarks eneral dmission theme park tickets start with single day options and top out at five day passes remember to specify park hopper tickets if you wish to skip between both parks in a single day o isneyland works well as an addition to any trip that brings you to alifornia rather than necessarily being the focus of a long vacation  is a destination that visitors commit multiple days to with one and two week visits increasingly popular and except for a few days at niversal lorida many people never leave the boundaries of the lorida resort at allinally there are attractions in alifornia that you won   t find in lorida and some special takes on some familiar  favourites that are exclusive to naheim ere are some of your exclusivesndiana ones and the emple of the orbidden ye

are visiting alifornia definitely try and add it to your list you   ll just have to determine how much time you   ll want to spend there e recommend between two and three days in low season and midweek if you   re visiting in high season the two parks can get quite full and the only guarantee of seeing and riding everything may be to stretch a visit out to four or five days     depending of course on just how    isney    you arehere   s no dining plan at isneyland and the park dining is limited when compared to  but there are a few great restaurants inside the gates reserve using the isneyland pp and some reasonable offerings nearbyf you   re familiar with  you won   t find magic bands or advance fast passes in alifornia but there have been recent changes to introduce a little

inevitably there is a lot of duplication between alifornia and lorida but there   s still plenty of unique experiences too espite the clamour from some isney fans that the company should replicate

       " \" have been to isneyland aris around  times now and am due to return this summer y last trip was march  and before writing anymore  just want to point a couple of things outhe bad reviews on here are shocking and honestly not a fair representation of the park at all efore you go there are a couple of things you should realise the park is in rance a uropean country s it so wrong that they should speak half of everything in rench o hey actually speak everything half rench and half nglish hey cater for mainly uropeans because the park is in urope  have been on rides like the irates of the aribbean for example where the whole ride has been in nglish other times in rench eople expect everything to be in nglish but really why should it be n my opinion seeing the signs for the rides in rench has always added to the magic for me and is something that makes the park different from the others ot something  would complain about he park is not a copy of anything elsey second point is the fact this is  lorida t is isneyland aris  completely different unique park with its own magic he castle in aris is completely unique to any in the world eople need to stop comparing the two o here with an open mind if you are lorida fanatic as it is different ot in a bad way by any means but a different experience y third point is that  have read reviews stating that the park has incredibly long queue lines omplaining over queuing ou are in isneyland aris f you go at peak times it is to be expected his isn't a hidden a fact ake the most of ast asses go to the rides during the parade one day get there early here are  ways round this he key is to plan your dayy fourth point is about the fact people have been saying this park can be completed in a day re you kidding  day here will not even give you a good enough taste for how amazing this park is et alone the fact alt isney tudios is just round the corner he park is not as small as people make it out to be he lands are uniquely themed and are different from the other parks in the world ou need tallest two full days to really get the best experience here here are many attractions to go on ome may look just like kids rides but go on them go on them all y fifth point is in regards to the food at isneyland aris or starters when comparing this to merica the food most likely is better in merica overall ost of the restaurants in isneyland aris do tend to be ast ood burgers chips hot dogs etc ith this being said the food isn't horrible t is good food t may be expensive but that is the uro for you f you are after more of a meal then there are plenty of good restaurants in and around the park but do be prepared that they may be expensive t the end of the day you are at isneyland xpect to pay a little extra y biggest tip is bring your own food f you are concerned about the price of food it is key that you bring packed lunch tock up from your hotel on breakfast here are ways round factors like where to eat t angers me that people write reviews complaining how food and queuing and it not being like lorida have ruined their whole trip t feels like they've come wanting it not to be as good and are looking for reasons to criticize this wonderful park he park has always been expensive with food depending on the time of year there have been long queues it may not be like lorida there may not be dozens of massive rollercoasters but all the rides and attractions here are first class some significantly better than lorida like irates of the aribbeaneople need to stop complaining over things that are to be expected f you go peak season it will be busy ut you get more entertainment here will be stuff in rench but you're in rance so why wouldn't there be here will be queues for rides he park will most likely be busy ut you are in a theme park hat are you expecting his place is truly magical he magic is there everytime  visit he rides only seem to get better with every go isneyland aris are improving month by month he latest isney dreams gives real credit to the efforts of the magineers improving isneyland aris eople need to stop cristising the park without fair or justifiable means  would highly recommend visiting here t will be a trip you never forget a magical one at that\",\n",

off and the key thing is that timing is everything efore we left i read reviews that people didn't meet many characters or queued for too long  have to say its timing he first day we got to our hotel nna and lsa where doing a meet and greet but for the hotel guests only isneyland hotel we didn't know but it was all about timing anyway that was nice for my daughter but she was to gobsmacked to actually go meet themthe park itself was very busy and i'd recommend anyone with young children to hire the strollers they have in the park if you don't have a buggy e only had a buggy for our  year old and we braved  days without for my  year old before we hired its  euro's per hire and it makes life so much easier not only for parents but for the child too it was very hot when we went and asking a  year old to walk all over the park in the heat isn't feasible ou can take the stroller to the the other park but you leave a refundable  euro depositiming get on the rides in antasyand early in the day they aren't as busy as everyone is queuing to meet the isney characters on ain treet e were able to go to  its a small world  brilliant ride  torybook land boat ride   asey r train ride  and  ad hatters tea cups  pretty quickly with not much queuing time as we got to that part of the park early while the majority were at the  start  of the park we had the special hours as part of the hotel we stayed at but we never made it out early enoughthe queue for the dumbo flying ride was long all day best time to catch it was around  we only queued for  mins he peter pan ride really isn't worth the  minute queue we had a fastpass and glad we didn't queue for ages for it he lice in onderland aze is great fun toon iscoveryand the best rides for us were utopia and uzz ightyear ast last we went on it twice used fastpass againn rontierand we didnt find much suitable in terms for ides for the kids but the dventure sle exploration was great as was the walk through it over the bridges etc owever there is one main attraction this summer in rontierand at the happaral theaterthe rozen singalong the kids loved it he queue isn't that badstart queuing about  mins before the start we did and we were not far from the front and were abler to pick the seats we wanted the singalong itself it great fun  wont give the details away but its worth it and you singalong to the songs as seen in the movie with the characters dancing and singing ion stage t gets hot in the theatre so take watern the alt isney ark make sure you do the atatouille ride its brilliant its a long queue again we used fast pass e had lunch at hez emy i will cover that in a restaurant review but its a great restaurant e then did the slinky ride which was about  mins in the queue and the ars rally ride which was about  minutes he rush oaster ride looked good but my kids were young for it same with the toy story parachute dropmeeting characters e were lucky we managed to book a different character meal each day and we met pretty much everyone there was apart from eter an endy and inkerbell ook a character dinner at inventions we met captain hook mr smee chip or dale forget which one now tigger pluto mickey the dinner at afe ickey you meet tigger pluto mickey goofy  the rincess dinner at uberge e endrillon we met riel inderella and elle and if you are there on the unday book the brunch at nventions we met mickey minnie ariel chip and dale donald daisy t does change weekly though ooking these dinners helped with not having to queue too much outside to meet characters tho we did queue at alt isney ark to meet mickey as the queue was only  mins and we met uzz ightyear there too queue was only  minutes both characters we went around amo the uffalo ills ild est show it starts off slow but gets better and its worth it all in all he crowd interaction is funboth my kids loved it and the events are great fun ou see mickey and friends and its worthwhile they aren't just there for  minutesn a side note we did the fotopass thing this is only useful if you do all the meet and greets in the park and the princess for a day thing which we didn't do we only did  and didn't get much use out of the  euro's spent worthwhile however if you plan on doing all of the abovehe parade starts at pm get in place by about  somewhere along the route its really good but be warned if you are at the back of the park past the isney astle and want to get to the exit you have to wait till he parade is done hey clear path ways as it goes but the exit area is the last to be clearedo make sure you visit the firework show it starts at pm people start getting a good seat from about pm ell worth itisney illage is good if you want a break from the parks they have coffee places and a massive isney store worth a lookuick summaryire the strollersook dinners to meet characters less queuing outside if you don't mind meeting them while eating you do get more time with them as wellet to the back of

overhaul on is the t's a mall orld ride he upgrades to that ride actually make it more creepy and kind of offensiveoh and by the way who ever heard of  a company like iemens in a children's ride ome on isneyland seriously  was also disappointed by the new way they do ast asses where  have to wait until after the end time of my current one to get another one that really is inconvenient when some rides put you many hours out into the future by am like ndiana oneswe got s for that ride at am and it told us to come back at pm so we couldn't get any additional s until after pm he ndiana ones ride by the way broke down right before the start window for our ast ass so they let us come back later nd then the end climax of the ride didn't work so we had to ride it again  remember that ride always seeming to have a ton of problems ow all these complaints aside've never seen isneyland look so clean  haven't been since  but prior to that  went nearly every year and this place is looking good was very impressed with how clean they keep the park even when there's tons of people everywhere    e also were there during the iamond elebration and we were able to get our photos taken on a photo pass at a whole bunch of different places lthough  do want to mention that they should have better explained this somehow because we missed a lot of opportunities to do this because we didn't figure out how to identify the spots where you could get photos on a pay pass until the last few hours of our visit es it's in the guide but it would just have been awesome to have a more in your face explanation nd buying all the photos is super cheap so that would have been even more cool ou can download an entire day's worth of photos for  so if you hit every spot on the map for a special photo you'd get probably  photos nd you can do it in alifornia dventure too y favorite one was the one where they had us hold out our hands and then in the final photo inkerbell is totally sitting in our hands t was awesome  am just really sad that we didn't get to take full advantage of all of that eally important if you have food allergies or intolerances   he restaurants for sitdown eating in both parks serve really excellent food t one place we had cranberry apple salads with candied walnuts and apple vinaigrette and it was to die for nd cheap t is a small salad off the appetizer menu but it was filling because it was full of fiber and it was  nd in any restaurant 've ever been in with something like that that kind of salad at that size is usually  or more so  found it to be a great value he waiter was also fabulously nice nd  forgot his name which makes me mad at myself because  would have loved to write to isney and tell them how incredible he wase're talking op  service encounters of my adult life n fact 'd really put him op  alongside the waiters that always serve me at uth's hris teakhouse lso the guy who sold me my frozen chocolate dipped banana was adorable and awesomend that reminds me ongratulations to isney on getting with the healthy program  was a tad concerned about eating options because  have some food intolerances here were food stands  in isneyland where  could buy huge apples individually bagged for sanitation fruit cups hummus cups vegetable trays even pineapple spears nd they even had itamin ater and itamin ater ero ou pay a premium  for an apple but it was totally worth it because  realize that less people are taking those healthy options and the fact that they made this available to me was really important e originally thought we'd have to leave the park during the day to eat or pack in a bunch of food and  brought a ton of medication to deal with my intolerances and then not having to deal with all of that was just soooo incredible and was a big stress relieft was overcast nearly the entire time we were there and  feel that we never waited longer than about  minutes for a ride pace ountain was maybe  minutes but we were in line with a bunch of other people before the ride even opened for the day isneyland also seems a much happier place to work because my past trips have always had at least one bad encounter with an employee who clearly hated their job but everyone  talked to was so nice e stopped in the tavern in antasyland for dinner one night and the girl who runs and ushers the line was just so friendly and there was another employee off shift in front of me in line who talked to me too the whole wait too and then the guy  talked to when  was waiting for my special order was also great  want to point out again on the food front that everywhere  asked for a special order the people were   and very accommodating  apologized for making it difficult and was told every time  ou are not being difficult ou have a good intolerance and it is not a problem for us to accommodate that  nd there was a pizza and pasta place in alifornia dventure where the manager came out and asked me if  would rather have my salad made in the back away from the possibility of cross contamination and when  said that was not a concern because a little bit of cheese wouldn't kill me he expressed that he didn't want me to even have a little bit of discomfort  am really surprised because we live in tah and most places act like 'm cutting them off at the knees if  ask them to wrap a burger in lettuce instead of putting it on a bun or if  ask them to make my salad without cheese on top hese people were all amazing and it was really great to feel cared about\",\n",

       " 'rrived during the nd week of arch and had a  day admission ticket here were relatively little crowds during the weekdays and the temperature during this time is cool between  to  degrees elsius he park must visit rides include the iron man experience and for pre schoolers all rides in fantasy land he picture taking with the various characters would take up most of ur time as crowds magically appear whenever these sessions are on ',\n",
       " \"e love isney so this is always going to be a biased review owever if anyone is thinking that they won't do it because they like isneyworld lorida and it cannot compare you must must do isneyland and alifornia dventure  nearly didn't and am so glad we did both just perfect magic he queuing is similar to other isney's ie the childrens eter an ride will have an outrageous queue even at park open\",\n",
       " \" hadn't been to isneyland for about  years and my little ones were finally ready to go t's still awesome reat rides shows and attractions super fun and super pricey but if you have children or are a kid at heart you have to go  would suggest spending at least  days to try and see and do it all at both parks se your magic mornings and fast passes\",\n",
       " 't was so much fun rom walking through the streets to hugging ickey ouse and riding the ndiana ones coaster e prepared for a big crowd any time of the year but it is worth it',\n",
       " 'y first ever isneyland couldnt ask for more ides were good shows were good performers were all excellent ides more towards kids friendly ut theres a couple of adult rides verall a great experience',\n",
       " 'e enjoyed a great week at isneyland and its sister park aving been to isney orld parks several times we of course were making comparisons he food service is faster at the lorida parks quick service was all we patronized and the ride loading is more efficient at the lorida parks as well he crowd control for the parades was superior at isneyland he rating would have been  excellent  if the number of rides breaking down had not been so many and so frequenttill none of it was a show stopper and we really did have a good time',\n",
       " \"imply ow such a beautiful place created by isney ent with my entire family during ul  it was peak summer season thus the place was quiet crowded with many visitors ne must go with bit of homework and planning as to what all to visit and please go early morning e reached around   and it was already crowded and there were long ue for every ride hough each ride was excellent be it the emo ride of ountain thrill rides omething to do for each age group est was the evening show of ater  aser which was mesmerizing and the late evening firework show was out of the world or me it is definitely one of those once in a lifetime experience ip se the nfant or bay switch option in case you're travelling with a nfant   id this was a very good feature\",\n",
       " \"ood he theme park is well maintained acility is accessible and clean taff are friendly and well presented professional lose to airport and isney styled subway is fantasticad dmission is too expensive acked with nasty visitors ueue jumping happens all the time here are nasty people purposely enter your view when taking photos omeone worse even dare to tell you move away unfriendly because they want to take pictures ompletely disasters ames are not exciting enough  guess it's because they need to care about younger kids ood is expensive lthough you would expect that but management can control it better believe it can be demographic issue since  never come across all these bad things in merican and apanese isneylandood luck\",\n",

       " 'o we went to isney land and our age ranged from   t was great day oute caught the isney express out which a cool themed train totally didn   t expect ite bought our tickets online prior to going so simple he rides are friendly and not tooo freaky he only one that got me was the tar ars one but that   s because    m a scaredy cat owever it was still freaking excitinghe light spectacular parade was awesome recommend downloading the app prior to attending as you can see the cue timest   s clean perfect everyone is happy and friendly  have not done any other isneyland   s else where but  still enjoyed it for what it is worth ',\n",
